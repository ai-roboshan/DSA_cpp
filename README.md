This repo contains C++ implementations of fundamental Data Structures (like arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs) and Algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy, etc.). It’s ideal for learning, practicing, and preparing for coding interviews or competitive programming. Contributions are welcome!
